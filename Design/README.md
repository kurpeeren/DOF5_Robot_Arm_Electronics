# Robot Arm Control Project

Welcome to the Robot Arm Control Project! This repository contains the necessary resources to control a 3D robot arm using an electronic control module.

## Circuit Board Design

The circuit board for the robot is an integral part of this project. You can find the open-source drawings and designs for the circuit board enclosure in the **/Circuit_Designs** directory. These drawings are provided for your reference and use.

## 3D Model Drawings

The design drawings for the robot arm are also available for exploration. These drawings offer insights into the mechanical structure of the robot arm. You can access the robot arm's design drawings on [Thangs](https://thangs.com/designer/HowToMechatronics/3d-model/Robotic%20Arm%203D%20Model-38899).
